        <h2>MPC - Overall Idea</h2>
        State Space techniques rely on current state and previous outputs. Here, we want to incorporate future beliefs with knowledge of the model.
        <h4>Loss, model, and constraints</h4>
        We predict a trajectory with our model, and assign a cost:

        $$Loss = \sum^T_{t=0}g(x_t, u_t) $$
        Where g gives some trajectory loss corresponding to the inputs u and and states x at all times in the trajectory t={0,T}
        E.G: A weighted sum of errors and actuator demands (like LQR)

        <p>The model gives a predictive representation of the dynamics:
        $$x_{t+1} = x_t + \delta t * dynamics$$
        E.G:
        $$x_{t+1} = x_t + \delta t * v_t$$
        </p>
        <p>The constraints encode domains of allowed states and inputs. E.G:
            $$U_t = [u| a_{min} <= a <= a_{max}]$$ Stay within acceleration bounds
            $$X_t = [x| p_{x}^2 + p_y^2 <=1]$$ Stay within 1m of origin
        </p>
        <h4>Formulation</h4>
        Minimize the trajectory cost that does not violate constraints:
        $$min_{x_{1:T}, u_{1:T}}$$ subject to $$x_{t+1} = f(x_t, u_t) ; u = [U_t]; x = [X_t]; x_1 = X_0$$
        
        <h4>Practical Solving</h4>
        In general, there is no closed form solution. Solving is done in <a href = "https://web.casadi.org/">CasADi</a> (Python, C++, Matlab)
        <h4>Considerations</h4>
        <li>Long term trajectories are expensive to compute</li>
        <li>Model errors will accumulate over time</li>
        <b>Solution</b>: Only run for a short horizon, query the system, and reevaluate. There is a tradeoff between shortsighted behavior and computation(E.G accelerating too close to a turn we can't see and overshooting). A possible solution is a zero-velocity end condition.
        
        <p><li>Complexity increases accuracy, but makes calculation difficult</li>
        <li>Identifying system characteristics like friction and drag are difficult</li>
        <b>Solution: </b> Determine unknown parameters by collecting real system behavior, and optimizing parameters relative to the real behavior
